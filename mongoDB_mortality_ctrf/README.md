[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is NoSQL Database system. It has advantages for my purpose over RDBMS, e.g. MySQL, storing the data efficiently. 

I am using [MongoDB](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo) and [its web-base management service](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo-express) with [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/).   
    Mounted volume is "mongodb"  
    To access MongoDB Express: https://localhost:8081   
    ID: admin, PW: admin.
